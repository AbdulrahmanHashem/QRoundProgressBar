This is a port of QRoundProgressBar (https://sourceforge.net/projects/qroundprogressbar) to Python 3 PyQt5.

![Demo](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/proj/qroundprogressbar/screenshots/RoundBars.png/1)

Run TestWidget.py to see it working.

I've also included the original C++ project's documentation in the docs folder which you should easily be
able to follow and apply to PyQt5 as per usual.
